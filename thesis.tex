% Example SDSU Mathematics LaTeX Thesis.
% Lines beginning with % are comments and are ignored.
% 
% The class file sdsu-thesis.cls must be in the current directory or
% installed with the other classes as per standard LaTeX installation.
% 
% To generate run these commands:
% latex  thesis
% bibtex thesis
% latex  thesis
% latex  thesis
% Then you need to use the dvips command to get postscript output
% 
% See the README file for more information
% 
\documentclass{sdsu-thesis}
% 
% For early printouts to save paper use the savepaper option as
% 
% \documentclass[savepaper]{sdsu-thesis}
% 
% 
% This will make things single spaced, use small font and smaller
% margins.  Stuff will be formatted differently if you don't use this
% option but it's useful to basically see (read) what you typed so far
% on paper without wasting much paper.  You might want to also comment
% out the front matter and backmatter if printing out in savepaper
% mode to save paper there.  Do not use this option on your final
% printout as it doesn't satisfy the thesis manual requirements.
%
% Also if you want to use double spacing rather then singlespacing (if
% your thesis is very short, say 25 pages or less), then use the
% `doublespace' option as
% 
% \documentclass[doublespace]{sdsu-thesis}
%
% For including graphics use
% (Info) http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Importing_Graphics
%
% NOTE: My *may* need the graphicx package to get the correct
% page-size (letter) for your document... Some environments,
% e.g. TeXnicCenter default to 'a4' page size.
\usepackage{epsfig}
\usepackage{graphicx}


% JAM - added 
\usepackage{verbatim}
\usepackage{epstopdf}
\usepackage{upgreek}
\usepackage{mathtools}

% These packages may also be useful for pictures...
% \usepackage{color}
% \usepackage{eepic}
% \usepackage{epic}
% \usepackage{grapic}


% Since this is a math thesis, you quite likely want these:
\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage{amsfonts}
\usepackage{amssymb}
\usepackage{amsthm}

% This makes captions *bold*
%
%(NOTE): Adding "justification=justified,singlelinecheck=false" to the
%        list of options will force all captions (including "short
%        one-line") to be left justified.  This is technically
%        required by the DTM, but looks ugly.
\usepackage[bf,labelsep=period,textfont=bf]{caption}

% Other useful packages for theses (see LaTeX docs for descriptions of these)
% 
% For the \vref commands that also prints out the reference page
% \usepackage{varioref}
% 
% For including computer code
% \usepackage{alltt}
% 
% For the \url{http://foo.com} command to include url's (or filenames)
% \usepackage{url}
% 
% For multi page tables
\usepackage{longtable}
%
% For correct "List of Tables" entry:
% (1) find the file "longtable.sty"
% (2) find the line
%     "\addcontentsline{lot}{table}{\protect\numberline{\thetable}{#2}}}%"
% (3) change to
%     "\addcontentsline{lot}{table}{\protect\numberline{Table\nobreakspace \thetable}{#2}}}%"


% This package countains the \sout command (which you should never use!)
\usepackage[normalem]{ulem}

  I would like to thank Dr.~Gauss for allowing me to work on this
  thesis even though he has been dead for so many years.  I would also
  like to thank Dr.~Bolzano for not having any comments on this thesis,
  and I would like to thank Dr.~Knuth for being the only living person
  on my thesis committee, and for writing the wonderful \TeX.

  This thesis is partially protected against the evil forces of the
  Montezuma Publishing thesis reviewers by the magic of the Department
  of Mathematics and Statistics Master's Thesis \LaTeX{} Template.
